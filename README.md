Overview

Hello, [this](https://github.com/vanAken/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3_VOLKER_VAN_AKEN/blob/master/P3_van_Aken.pdf) is my writeup template as a pdf.


My project video is named video.mp4.
 
In additional you find a second video named oediv.mp4

What i do was to Use the keys "w" and "s" in autonomous modus and turn the car in the opposite direction.

Is the car possible to drive backwards the challenge track? - This is also a hint to answers the question:

"What does oediv mean!" 

One open question was: "Is that model general?"

So i try a new track, which has nerver been trained before - the old mountain track.

The result you can see here: mountain.mp4.
